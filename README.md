# Project 2: Garage Sale Finder

## Project Summary

### Description
This project allows people hosting nearby garage sales to share their garage sale to our database where the public can find a nearby garage sale.

### Motivation
There is not really a solution for this product already. You can post on craigslist, but there is no way to really make yours stand out by location or by the categories of items in it.

### Results
The project allows people to post new sales and find sales.
